## Description

I made this program with the intention of adding it to my digitl portfolio. I enjoyed puuting all of what ive learned into this project and learning more. I couldent do the full five day forcast like in the. \assets\Refrence\Assets\06-server-side-apis-homework-demo.png as the max call of data I can do is 40, and each point is in 3 hour intevals so that means thats 8 poins per for 5 days. One day is the current day that leaves 4 future days. I did do the future forecast with five days to prove I could do it but one is a duplicate of todays forcast.

## Usage

Simply input the name of your city and hit the search button to see the weather for the next five days
